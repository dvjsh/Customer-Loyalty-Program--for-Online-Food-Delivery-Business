# Customer-Loyalty-Program--for-Online-Food-Delivery-Business

A customer loyalty program has been proposed that incentivizes regular ordering or referrals to our online food delivery business. The program increases customer engagement, retention, and lifetime value, and provides valuable insights into customer behavior. The program is personalized for different customer segments and offers exclusive rewards and incentives. It optimizes the program and informs marketing, product development, and customer service. The aim is to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience, build strong customer relationships, and drive business growth. The loyalty program helps achieve these goals and makes the service a go-to for customers.

#### Data:
Starbucks app customer rewards program data from Kaggle has been referred to to design this program. The datasets contains information about different kinds of offers that were sent to customers as part of a rewards program, provides important demographic information about customers who participate in the rewards program and the status of the offer as well as the amount spent by the customer on a transaction associated with the offer.
